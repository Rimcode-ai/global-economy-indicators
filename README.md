## Introduction

The financial stability of corporations is a cornerstone of economic health, influencing not only individual organizations but also broader market dynamics and investor confidence. This project explores the use of advanced machine learning techniques to assess and predict corporate financial stability based on critical financial and economic indicators. By leveraging historical data and modern analytical tools, the study aims to identify key factors influencing stability and provide actionable insights for corporate decision-making and risk management.

Corporate financial stability is often challenged by factors such as high leverage, insufficient liquidity, and external economic pressures. Addressing these challenges requires robust predictive models capable of handling complex relationships within data.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze corporate financial stability using a machine learning approach to achieve the following:

1. Identify the financial and economic indicators that have the most significant impact on corporate financial stability.
2. Develop a predictive model that classifies companies into financially stable and unstable categories.
3. Address the challenges of imbalanced datasets using advanced sampling techniques like SMOTE+Tomek Link.
4. Evaluate the predictive performance of machine learning models in comparison to traditional models.
5. Provide actionable insights into financial metrics and external economic factors that influence corporate health and stability.
6. Establish a feature importance ranking to guide decision-making and risk assessment for stakeholders.

This project aims to combine data-driven techniques with financial domain knowledge to enhance our understanding of corporate stability and deliver reliable predictive insights for practical applications.
