# Analysis of Country and Currency in Global Economic Indicators Dataset

## Project Definition
The dataset contains global economic indicators for various countries over time, including both numeric and non-numeric attributes. Non-numeric columns like country names and currency types can provide valuable insights into regional economic trends, currency distributions, and country-specific factors influencing the economy. However, these attributes are often overlooked in quantitative analyses. This project aims to explore and analyze the non-numeric data to identify patterns, correlations, and actionable insights.

## Problem Statement
While numeric data such as GDP and GNI are frequently analyzed for economic insights, non-numeric attributes like countries and currencies are often underutilized. These attributes hold the potential to:

- Highlight regional economic trends.
- Explore the diversity and distribution of currencies.
- Understand country-specific economic behaviors.

This project seeks to bridge this gap by conducting a detailed analysis of the non-numeric columns, uncovering relationships between these attributes and numeric economic indicators.

## Objective
To analyze and interpret non-numeric columns (e.g., Country, Currency) in the dataset to:

1. Uncover regional or categorical economic trends.
2. Assess the diversity and distribution of currencies.
3. Identify relationships between categorical attributes (e.g., Country, Currency) and numeric indicators like GDP and GNI.
4. Support data-driven decision-making for macroeconomic strategies and policy development.

## Key Analysis Questions
Below are ten guiding questions for the analysis:

1. **Country-level Trends**: What are the top 10 countries with the highest average GDP and GNI over the available years? Are there notable trends or patterns across regions?
   
2. **Currency Distribution**: How is the dataset's Currency column distributed across countries? Are there any predominant currencies or regions with unique currencies?

3. **Regional Analysis**: Do certain regions (inferred from Country) show distinct economic behaviors, such as higher reliance on agriculture versus manufacturing?

4. **Temporal Analysis**: How do economic trends (like GNI or GDP) change over time for specific countries or regions? Are there spikes or dips that can be explained by external events?

5. **Economic Indicator Correlation**: Are there correlations between the non-numeric data (e.g., Country, Currency) and major economic indicators such as GDP or imports/exports?

6. **Categorical Impact**: Does the type of currency used significantly impact economic growth (e.g., GDP per capita)?

7. **Anomalies**: Are there anomalies or outliers in GDP or GNI for specific countries or currencies? What might explain these?

8. **Country-Currency Relationship**: Are there patterns or trends linking certain currencies to better economic performance in their respective countries?

9. **Visualization**: Can we create a world map visualization showing GDP and GNI distribution by Country? How does this inform about global economic disparities?

10. **Policy Insights**: Based on the data, what recommendations can be made for countries to improve their economic performance? For instance, should they invest more in specific sectors (e.g., manufacturing vs. agriculture)?

## Tasks for Data Scientists and ML Engineers
1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure the dataset is clean, with consistent formatting for non-numeric columns.
2. **Data Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on non-numeric columns to understand their structure and distribution.
3. **Visualization**: Generate compelling visualizations, such as:
   - Distribution of currencies.
   - Regional GDP and GNI trends.
   - Country-level maps for economic indicators.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Encode non-numeric columns for correlation analysis with numeric indicators.
5. **Modeling**: Explore relationships between non-numeric attributes and numeric outcomes using machine learning models where appropriate.
6. **Insight Extraction**: Summarize findings to highlight actionable insights for policymakers.

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive analysis of the non-numeric columns in the dataset.
- Visualizations to aid understanding of economic trends and disparities.
- Insights into the impact of categorical variables (e.g., Country, Currency) on numeric indicators (e.g., GDP, GNI).
- Recommendations for data-driven economic strategies and policies.
